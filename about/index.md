Investing isn&#8217;t about money. Throughout our lives, we invest not only money, but time and sweat into the things we hope will bring us happiness and meaning. Investing is not merely a process for security selection; it is a way of looking at the world, hoping to maximize what is truly important to us. Investments that save us time and effort or help others are often times just as valuable, if not more so, than financial gain. This site hopes to help build a community of individuals who look at the world through the eyes of a long term value investor, akin to Charlie Munger, and find meaning and worth in places others miss. Value investing should not solely be relegated to thorough analyses of financial data as value investing opportunities are all around us, if we know where to look.

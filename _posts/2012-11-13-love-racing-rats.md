Love the process, not the outcome.

I know, I know. More of that hippie, happy, positive psychology that plagues blog posts on entrepreneurship scribbled all over <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://news.ycombinator.com']);" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>. Trite. Overused.

And rarely followed.

Just realizing how much rat racing I do in my life (i.e. someone who puts off things that make them happy for tomorrow&#8217;s happiness) and how it really isn&#8217;t getting me far. I read first about the problems with delayed gratification years ago in Tal Ben Shahar&#8217;s book, &#8220;<a title="The Question of Happiness" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Zwp1ej9c-lsC&source=gbs_similarbooks" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://books.google.com']);">The Question of Happiness.</a>&#8221; I was surprised when my organizational psychology professor friend recommended the book to me as it looked straight out of the bargain bin section of Half Priced Books, right next to &#8220;How to be A Ninja Assassin Even if You&#8217;re Some White Guy&#8221; by some white, bearded guy named Stephen and possibly some of David Allen&#8217;s early work. However, Shahar&#8217;s book was pretty simple, had some good data behind it, and seemed to jibe with my intuitive sense of happiness. One of the main takeaways; you&#8217;ve got to enjoy with what you&#8217;re doing now, or you ain&#8217;t gonna be happy.

One of my real joys in life is writing. Like a true Rat Racer, I stopped writing blog posts for fear that it was pulling me far away from where I felt I should be, getting a small company off the ground. Instead, I gave up one of the most powerful tools to solving incredibly difficult problems, writing about them.

You can enjoy your life AND get a business off the ground. Now, I&#8217;m saying this as I&#8217;m struggling to do just that and as everything else I&#8217;ve helped start required more sacrifice than I&#8217;m willing to give now, but I&#8217;m still betting on the fact that it&#8217;s right. The best way to put long hours into something is if you&#8217;re enjoying it. Ask <a title="Yo-Yo Ma on Practice" href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/inspiring-as-well-as-educating/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://news.harvard.edu']);">Yo-Yo Ma</a>.

None of this is new. None of this you haven&#8217;t heard before. I&#8217;m just saying it a little differently, mostly as a reminder to myself.

To provide a variation on another overused example, sometimes being the <a title="Marshmallow Experiment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">kid who eats the marshmallow first</a> is good, as long as you find vitamin packed razzmatazz marshmallows of awesomeness. Said another way using the Hacker News parlance of the time, product/founder/market fit doesn&#8217;t just exist in a vacuum. It&#8217;s also a good idea to enjoy the act of creating the product, if you want it to work out.

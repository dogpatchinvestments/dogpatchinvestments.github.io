## Follow the Money, Don&#8217;t Follow Opinion

Every month I update my portfolio and allow myself to look at the prices of all my investments.  The reason for this is I found myself up till recently checking my portfolio WAY too often, ( as mentioned in my article on <a title="Prevent Anchoring" href="http://www.valuablebehavior.com/behavioral-investing/stock-anchoring/"  target="_blank">why I&#8217;m a dopamine addict</a> ) and I needed a way to prevent the movements of the market from affecting my investing process.  I still occasionally check the price for a stock I&#8217;m likely to buy or sell within the week, and obviously I don&#8217;t limit my intake of business fundamental information, but I do try to **keep myself from knowing my portfolio&#8217;s market &#8220;performance&#8221; as I feel it&#8217;s not an accurate indicator of how my portfolio is doing.**

During my monthly updates, I adjust the number of shares of each security I own and their trailing twelve month free cash flow per diluted share, then sum up my trailing twelve month free cash flow for my &#8220;holding company&#8221; for the trailing year.  At present I don&#8217;t figure in my cash position or my company&#8217;s cash position as I consider both free cash flow &#8220;growth drivers.&#8221;  A company with extra free cash flow can use that to buy back stock, or fund acquisitions or expansions, so a company with extra cash on the balance sheet has means to grow free cash flow faster.  Dividends and my extra cash also just mean that I have another way to grow my holding company&#8217;s free cash flow in the future.  I could use a multiple, say 15, to divide into extra cash and say that this cash would produce on average this free cash flow, but I prefer to leave it out and know that it will be a growth driver for free cash flow.  Geoff Gannon has a <a title="Asset Earnings Equivalence" href="http://www.gannononinvesting.com/blog/asset-earnings-equivalence.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.gannononinvesting.com']);" target="_blank">great article </a>on why assets and cash flows should be thought of as interchangeable and this has helped me model some of my thinking around this.

Also, I&#8217;d love to use a company&#8217;s &#8220;owner earnings&#8221; ( i.e. separating the capital expenditures that are for maintenance, subtracting them from earnings, then adding back in depreciation and amortization ), but companies seldom report such details, so I stick to free cash flow.  Free cash is ultimately a great measure of what I&#8217;m getting back from the company.

One last note, for banks, I often \*gasp\* use earnings since free cash flow gets muddled up in their cash flow statements.  Banks make determining free cash a rather murky exercise that I haven&#8217;t perfected, so I stick with earnings. As usual, make sure you feel confident about using the earnings, since earnings can be played with a bit more easily than free cash flow, especially in banks. If you&#8217;re doing your research on banks ( see my four part series <a title="Bank 1" href="http://www.valuablebehavior.com/banking/bank-analysis-1/"  target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Bank 2" href="http://www.valuablebehavior.com/banking/bank-analysis-2/"  target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Bank 3" href="http://www.valuablebehavior.com/banking/bank-analysis-3/"  target="_blank">here</a>, and <a title="Bank 4" href="http://www.valuablebehavior.com/banking/bank-analysis-4/"  target="_blank">here</a> ), you should be fine using it.

Ultimately, when you&#8217;ve summed everything, you&#8217;re left with a really good determination of how your &#8220;holding company&#8221; is doing.  If you&#8217;re trying to buy great businesses at a good price and hold them as long as you can, **you&#8217;ll be a better investor by focusing on the business fundamentals and ignoring the bi-polar nature of the market.**

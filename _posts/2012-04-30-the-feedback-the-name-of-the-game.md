Hi Folks!

After a bit of a hiatus, I&#8217;m glad to return to this blog. I have a new experiment to write about. For the next few months, I&#8217;m going to be trying to improve the quality, amount, and speed of the feedback we get as we build our business, <a title="Dogpatch Technology" href="http://www.dogpatchtech.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.dogpatchtech.com']);" target="_blank">Dogpatch Technology</a>.

One of the biggest problems in investing is the sheer time between when you make a decision and when you see true results. It&#8217;s often on the order of a decade or two if done with the usual &#8220;buy and hold an amazing business for as long as you can.&#8221; And, it&#8217;s one of the primary reasons why investing principles seem so simple, yet are often hard to apply. Whether the topic is investing, <a title="Fail Fast in Software" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/visualizing-code-to-fail-faster.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.codinghorror.com']);" target="_blank">engineering</a>, <a title="Medicine Feedback Loop Talk" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-10/13/massive-health" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.wired.co.uk']);" target="_blank">medicine</a>, or almost any other endeavor, the sooner we receive high quality feedback on what we&#8217;re doing, the sooner we can adapt, and the better we do. However, this can&#8217;t come at the expense of taking a long term perspective, and you have to ensure that feedback is high enough quality to take that into account. Paying attention to Graham&#8217;s &#8220;weighing machine&#8221; inputs and not the &#8220;voting machine&#8221; inputs is at the heart.

With this experiment, there&#8217;s going to be less emphasis on investing, and more emphasis on entrepreneurship, engineering, design, and all those aspects of actually running a business. You&#8217;ll probably see some things here you won&#8217;t normally see on your usual &#8220;analyze a company a week&#8221; investing blog, and I hope you&#8217;ll find it useful. Investing makes us better businesspeople and business makes us better investors. There are principles we&#8217;ll hopefully investigate in this blog that are universal to almost every discipline and industry (feedback being one that&#8217;s pretty hot at the moment). I hope we&#8217;ll be able to hit on more than a few.

So put on your micropreneur hats, get comfortable with the technology industry, and let&#8217;s see where the latest research into behavior change and feedback loops takes us.

Time for some fun.

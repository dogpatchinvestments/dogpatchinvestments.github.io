[<img class="size-full wp-image-157 alignleft" title="iPad, SEC, and annotation" alt="annotation" src="http://www.valuablebehavior.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/annotation.jpg" width="134" height="101" />][1]I will confess one of the main reasons I got an iPad is that I was **growing weary of being glued to my laptop** when having to read a 10Q or having to print out a bank&#8217;s 10K at 25 sheets with four pages to sheet so as not to print a tome and be forced to practically **read with a microscope**.  This just seemed to be counterproductive and something technology should handle appropriately.   So, I got an iPad.

## Morningstar Website

Up until recently, I&#8217;ve read SEC filings on <a title="Morningstar" href="http://www.morningstar.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.morningstar.com']);" target="_blank">Morningstar</a> either on my iPad or laptop.  I&#8217;d make a few notes in a Google spreadsheet, but I definitely haven&#8217;t been actively reading as much as I should.  Following my reading of Neil Golding&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gurufocus.com/news/129064/deliberate-practice--how-to-become-an-expert" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.gurufocus.com']);" target="_blank">post on Deliberate Practice</a>, I realized I needed to refine my process as I often am just reading.  **True critical reading involves annotating, underlining, and asking questions in the margins.** However, I don&#8217;t exactly have the ability to annotate a web page like I do on paper, which is a real downside, but definitely not an insurmountable one.

## Xamtech SEC Filings

Firing up the app store, I found Xamtech&#8217;s <a href="http://xamtech.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://xamtech.com']);" target="_blank">SEC Filings readers</a>.  They offered a few choices, and I opted for the XBRL one which was $20 and could display all types of filings.  At first, I got a bit excited.  The app had the ability to underline and annotate, even optional public sharing of annotations.  I could easily select any SEC filing for any company I followed and also convert the documents to PDF and mail them to myself.

However, it suffers from a number of deal-breaking flaws:

  1. **It only displays small sections of SEC filings at a time**, i.e. you can&#8217;t easily move around the entire document.
  2. **Search only applies to a small section**.  This drove me bonkers as full document search is absolutely vital.
  3. **You have to opt out of sharing each annotation you make**.  I understand them wanting to encourage sharing, but I should be able to turn it off forever in a single setting.

Hopefully they&#8217;ll update the app with these problems addressed, and I&#8217;ll give it another look.

## iAnnotate

I then switched to getting my SEC Filings in PDF format and reading them on my iPad with Aji&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ajidev.com/iannotate/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ajidev.com']);" target="_blank">iAnnotate</a>. iAnnotate seemed to have a daunting number of bells and whistles at first, but is rather simple to configure when you play with it.  Once I got scroll lock and page tap working, I&#8217;ve been **totally happy with underlining, annotating, even drawing on the document. **(Whenever I get the urge to write &#8220;WHAT THE HELL???!!!?&#8221; in the margins, I want to do so in my own handwriting.)  They even have the option of turning web pages into PDFs which means my dream of annotating everything I read may come to fruition.

Overall, I&#8217;m really happy with my new iAnnotate PDF setup.  I know I&#8217;m reading more critically and am using tools that don&#8217;t force reading glasses upon me.  I will update this post if I find something better.

**Full Disclosure:** *I have no interest or stake in any company product in this article.  However, I&#8217;m a software developer and someone who cares deeply about good tools.  Time wasted with an improper tool feels like a sin.  One which will occasionally cause me to write something myself largely because I just get annoyed and see an opportunity.*

*In the interest of full disclosure, I do plan on writing some investing tools, especially for mobile devices, and I started this blog not just to refine my investing process, but also to get feedback on investing tool ideas.  Any time ValuableBehavior does an investing tool review, I will be clear about whether I am planning to make such a tool, or am offering something I have made. Know that your feedback here or to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/truelson" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);" target="_blank">@truelson on Twitter</a> can help design future tools; tools that might help us become even greater investors.*

*At present, I am not planning on making an SEC Filing reader any time soon, but could be persuaded if I see a good reason to, and there&#8217;s enough demand.  For now, I&#8217;m pretty happy with PDFs and iAnnotate.*

Vacations are wonderful.  They give you perspective and are vital to your work life. Never think that it&#8217;s a virtue to not take vacations.  Good minds needs rest and perspective. And the insights are wonderful.

My main insight from this last vacation: it&#8217;s time to focus. Meaning, this blog will be taking a backseat to the rest of my work life until the business we&#8217;ve wanted to build is up and running.

I&#8217;ve learned that the most successful blogs publish on a regular, specified basis.  If you plan on blogging and want to be successful, go all out and publish regularly so people can expect you at a set time each week. Come up with well thought out content each time. In other words, if you&#8217;re going to do it, do it right and do it consistently.

And that requires time. Time I want to spend building a business first and then transitioning to investing and writing.

I&#8217;ll still be posting here, albeit on an irregular basis as my full effort will be devoted to building our software business. There may be more of an entrepreneurial slant, like how searching for good SEO keywords is similar to finding Graham net-nets or that <a title="Flippa" href="http://www.flippa.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.flippa.com']);" target="_blank">Flippa.com</a> is a really interesting market for a type of security called a website with thoughts on how to value one.

I&#8217;ve realized, I&#8217;m not ready yet for this blog, nor investing in general to receive my full attention. But, I can&#8217;t wait to return to it with a whole, new amount of useful content and a business standing behind it.

See you soon,

Palmer

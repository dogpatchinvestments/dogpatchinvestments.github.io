### **Privacy Policy for ValuableBehavior.com**

If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact me, Palmer, by email at info@dogpatchtech.com.

### Non-Legalese Disclosure

At ValuableBehavior.com, here&#8217;s what we do regarding privacy and ads. We run ads on this site, and that requires some tracking by Google, and we use Google Analytics to measure our traffic. We offer links to books on Amazon and any of these books we recommend are because we think these books are highly useful, and the small percentage we get if you buy one goes to supporting this site. I think it would only harm the site to recommend bad books. Also, nearly every WordPress site that has logins, has cookies. That&#8217;s what we do. Now for the more legal stuff&#8230;
